# Face Verification System
Using Facenet model as feature extractor and Scikit-Learn Isolation Forest as Selection Model. This system consist of 3 API. first is Registration API handle face detection, preprocessing and upload process. second is train model API, handle training process to produce face verification model for every user. third is verification model API. This API handle verification request from mobile apps checking if face simmilar and return the prediction result
